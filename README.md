# E-Commerce Customer Retention & RFM Analysis 📈

## Executive Summary
In this project, I acted as a Business Analyst for a major retail platform. The goal was to solve a classic Supply Chain and Marketing problem: **How do we know who our best customers are, and who is about to stop buying?**

## The Business Problem
Managing a massive database of over 100,000 orders makes it impossible to treat every customer the same. We needed a data-driven way to:
1. Identify **VIPs** (Champions) for loyalty rewards.
2. Flag **At-Risk** customers to prevent churn.
3. Optimize marketing spend by targeting the right groups.

## The Approach: RFM Modeling
I leveraged **AI-assisted Python development** to process three separate datasets (Customers, Orders, and Payments). I engineered an **RFM Model**:
* **Recency:** How many days since their last purchase?
* **Frequency:** How many times have they bought from us?
* **Monetary:** How much total revenue have they generated?

## Key Results
* **Churn Detection:** Identified a **5% churn risk** among previously active users.
* **Segment Insights:** Discovered that our "Champions" segment (Top 10% of users) drives nearly 40% of total revenue.
* **Data Pipeline:** Successfully merged and cleaned multi-source CSV data into a single analytical dataframe.

## Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pandas (Data Wrangling), NumPy (Calculations), Seaborn (Visualization)
* **Logic:** RFM Segmentation Algorithm
